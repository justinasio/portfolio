            <h1>Insights On My Streamers Application</h1>
            <p><a class="link" href="https://streamers.justinas.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Streamers</a> – is an application that shows a list of Twitch.tv streamers in order to promote them.</p>

            <h2>Why EJS?</h2>
            <p>Why did I choose a server-side rendering/templating language over a frontend framework like React to render the content of my application? To simply put everything into a retrospective, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to understand and write "vanilla" JavaScript code.</p>
            <p>I'm familiar with templating languages such as Pug and Handlebars, but most of my templating experience comes from EJS, a language that allows you to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript, which is exactly what I wanted for this project.</p>
            <p>Another reason was that I didn't want to integrate the web-server with the React environment, which I believe would have been overkill for this sort of application, but if I were to scale this project or add more functionality, that would of been the right approach.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article__item">
            <h2>Caching</h2>
            <p>As a Developer it is my responsability to deliver efficient and fast applications and I am all for caching content and improving performance, among other things, however...</p>
            <p>I was limited to a free tier Heroku hosting plan, which is, by the way, one of the best hosting platforms out there. You're probably wondering how I was limited and how it relates to caching.</p>
            <p>Well.. my initial plan was to hold data in RAM memory, using Redis, which would have made my application *x times faster, but the data does not persist if the server restarts/shuts down. That would negatively impact the experience of my application since the downside of using a free tier heroku plan is that the server frequently shuts down.</p>
            <p>In addition, I would have stored and proccessed images from the Twitch API, rather than serving them straight from their servers. I think there is a method to use Redis using Heroku extensions library, but I was prompted with a pay wall, so instead I used a fs (file system) module, that is surprisingly great for storing data in JSON format and also fast at retrieving it.</p>
            <p>If you're curious how I'm updating data every 3 minutes or so, it's quite simple: I have an interval that retrieves all channel names from MongoDB database then gets their data via Twitch API and stores it locally. <a class="link" href="https://github.com/justinasio/streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Check out</a> project's GitHub repository.</p>
            <pre>mongoose.connection.on('open', async () => {
    // Store channels data locally on boot
    await Twitch.storeChannelsData();

    // After that store channels data every 3 minutes
    setInterval(async () => {
        await Twitch.storeChannelsData();
    }, 1000 * 60 * 3);
            
    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
});</pre>

        <div class="article__item">
            <h2>Error Handling</h2>
            <p>Please don't be outraged, back-end developers, because I'm about to confess something to you. I used a SINGLE errorHandler function to manage MongoDB requests, a bit lazy, but not too bad, it does not fully crash the server if there are any issues, atleast there is that one error handling function to catch them, and it is extremely improbable that MongoDB services would go down, but I'm not naive, and I know the importance of error handling. If you were to ask me how I would improve this application further, I would start with error handling!</p>

        <div class="article__item">
            <h2>Carousel Component</h2>
            <p>Let's talk about the carousel. I was debating with myself if I should use any external libraries to make a carousel, but I'm glad that I created one myself the way I wanted it to be, using CSS and JavaScript. </p>
            <p>This is definitely one of my highlights of creating this project: I kept it lightweight and reusable, and I will definitely use it outside of the scope of this project.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article__item">
            <h2>Dashboard & Auth</h2>
            <p>I made a simple authentication and authorization system with permissions using JWT tokens and MongoDB database: if you wanted to create a new account right now, you would have "default" permissions, which wouldn't allow you to remove or add/store new channels using dashboard: for that, you need an account with "admin" permissions, which only one person has, and that is me.</p>
            <p>If you want to see the dashboard for yourself, I will provide test credentials and <a class="link" href="https://twitchstreamers.herokuapp.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a link to the dashboard</a>: If you try to make an account, it will not work since registration is now closed.</p>

            <p>Thank you for reading all the way to the end: There is a lot more information I can give you about this application, but since this is my first blog post, I wanted to highlight the most important aspects of the project: You can always  see the source code for yourself by visiting the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/justinasio/streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
