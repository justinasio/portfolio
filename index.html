    <p>I'm Justinas and I've always had an interest in technology. It has led me to teach myself various skills, including web development. I've done work as a freelancer, doing both front-end and back-end projects.</p>
    <p>These days, I'm exploring new opportunities and I'm currently enrolled in a college course. In a year, this will allow me to do a foundation degree in cloud computing.</p>
    <p>I will keep the website as it is for now, until I have something truly unique and impressive to showcase.</p>
